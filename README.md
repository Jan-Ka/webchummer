## About

> Old games deserve new Tools. And when fixing the established applications is no longer trivial, something new should take its place.  
> `webchummer` strives to become the one-stop-shop for all your Shadowrun compatible Character Generation needs.  
> Not a mean spirited rewrite but a gentle reinvention of a cherished thing.
